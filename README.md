# How this works

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
If you're running this locally, run `jekyll serve --watch` in your root directory.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/weisquared2/weiwei-design/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Directory Structure

You can find info about how the directory should be structured on the [Jekyll site](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) or in [this example project](https://github.com/ablarry91/portfolio).

## Command Line BS

If you're fucking around with command-line and you've forgotten how Vim works, at least here's how to exit edit mode in Terminal if you're panicking:

+ To save
++ press `esc`, type `:w`, hit `enter`

+ To exit
++ press `esc`, type `:q!`, hit `enter`
