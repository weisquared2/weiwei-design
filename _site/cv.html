<p>As a lifelong learner, I’m a proudly self-taught designer with roots in visual design and a background in neuropsychology &amp; computer science. Looking to combine and expand on my interests, I found my merry way to product and UX design, and haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m leading cross-functional UX alignment at <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, focused on deepening and broadening my UX, technical, and leadership skillsets.</p>

<h2 id="skills--tools">Skills &amp; Tools</h2>

<p>I’m well-versed in UX skills &amp; tools across the UX spectrum. I love designing holistic, precisely detailed, polished experiences, and craft user research with the same care to answer the right questions for the product.</p>

<p>I might have been a UX developer in another life, and I’m not ruling it out for this one — I love digging into code to see how it works, and occasionally write my own (like this website!). I take great pleasure in getting into the nitty-gritty of technical concepts.</p>

<p>I could never work alone. I love working with people with all sorts of backgrounds, and I’m constantly learning new ways of working together to leverage the skills of groups I work with. Strategic, intentional communication is at the heart of everything I do: from high-level stakeholder presentations to having effective, well-framed 1:1 conversations.</p>
