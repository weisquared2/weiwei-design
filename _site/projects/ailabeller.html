            <h3 id="project">Project</h3>

<p>I worked on an AI model development product, which was a product formed from several internal tools created by AI developers at Element AI to streamline internal workflows. The technical back-end was state-of-the-art, but lacked a front-end or cohesive user experience, relying solely on documentation for user guidance.</p>

<p>In particular, I focused on the data labelling tool, which facilitated collaboration between AI practitioners and data labellers during the labelling process. My role was the sole product designer, working with a front- and back-end dev, a product owner, and a UX researcher.</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>

<p>Starting a simple labelling task involved navigating a fragmented workflow across the command-line, JIRA, Slack, and two separate dashboards. The main goal was to transform the disjointed experience into a cohesive and guided flow.</p>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>

<p>I conducted in-context observations and desk research on the existing cross-platform task creation process. I paired these with high-level user flows that were the outputs of a design sprint run by my colleagues.</p>

<p>Using these inputs, I delivered revised user flows and rough prototypes of the task creation process. I validated the technical feasibility of the proposed prototypes with the front- and back-end developers.</p>

<p>I worked with the product owner and a UX researcher to identify what we wanted to focus on in user interviews, focusing on new concepts and flows that needed user validation.</p>

<p>Based on interview insights, I refined the high-fidelity prototypes, which were then implemented by the developers.</p>

<h3 id="end-result">End result</h3>

<p>The resulting task creation process was much easier to use and learn, and eliminated the need to jump between platforms just to initiate a task. This also made the product significantly more appealing in sales demos.</p>

<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>

<p>During this process, I learned where to build on existing design patterns that had already proven to be effective: for example, AI practitioners frequently needed to attach instructions to their labelling tasks, which often came as a Google Doc. We spent a few iterations trying to flesh out the rich text editing capabilities of our text field before deciding based on testing to simplify it into a field for pasting a Google Doc link, which fit in better with their existing workflow.</p>

<p>I learned to spot and challenge my assumptions about user thinking, and I also learned the value in testing at multiple levels, using both high-fidelity mockups to test usability, and abstract concepts to challenge broader workflow assumptions.</p>
