# Hi, I'm Wei-Wei!

I'm a product designer currently building the UI foundations for the [Unity Editor](https://unity.com/products/unity-platform), unravelling years worth of design inconsistency debt and breaking down silos in the Unity design community.

My favourite problems to work on are complex, technical, messy ones. I'm at my best when breaking down complex concepts and technologies into a simple, clear product experience. My secret weapon is strategic, intentional communication &mdash; to me, design is not just an end result, but a communication and alignment tool for framing discussions.

Outside of work, I love to crochet, dance, and start debates about whether or not hot dogs are sandwiches.
