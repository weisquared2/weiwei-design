## Hi! I'm Wei-Wei, a product designer.

My favourite problems to work on are complex, technical, messy ones. I'm at my best when breaking down complex concepts and technologies into a simple, clear product experience.

My secret weapon is strategic, intentional communication. To me, design is not just an end result, but a communication and alignment tool for framing discussions.

Most recently, I lead a team of designers at [Unity](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine) clarifying the product experience for creatives through design systems and cross-unit alignment.
