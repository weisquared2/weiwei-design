# Hi, I'm Wei-Wei!

I'm a product designer currently working on unravelling years worth of design inconsistency debt for the [Unity Editor](https://unity.com/products/unity-platform).

### Probably add some more stuff to this paragraph and maybe some more stuff to this page in general
My favourite problems to work on are complex and messy ones. If it means I get to ask a bunch of questions to dig into technical details, even better!

Outside of work, I love to crochet, dance, and start debates about whether or not hot dogs are sandwiches.
