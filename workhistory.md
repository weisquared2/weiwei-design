# Work History

As a lifelong learner, I'm a proudly self-taught designer with roots in visual design, and a background in neuropsychology & computer science. Looking to combine and expand on my interests, I found my merry way to product and UX design &mdash; I haven't looked back since.

Currently, I'm leading cross-functional UX alignment at [Unity](https://unity.com/), focusing on deepening and broadening my UX, technical, and leadership skillsets.
