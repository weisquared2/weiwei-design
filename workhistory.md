As a lifelong learner, I'm a proudly self-taught designer with roots in visual design and a background in neuropsychology & computer science. Looking to combine and expand on my interests, I found my merry way to product and UX design, and haven't looked back since.

Currently, I'm leading cross-functional UX alignment at [Unity](https://unity.com/), focused on deepening and broadening my UX, technical, and leadership skillsets.

## Skills & Tools

I'm well-versed in UX skills & tools across the UX spectrum. I love designing holistic, precisely detailed, polished experiences, and craft user research with the same care to answer the right questions for the product.

I might have been a UX developer in another life, and I'm not ruling it out for this one &mdash; I love digging into code to see how it works, and occasionally write my own (like this website!). I take great pleasure in getting into the nitty-gritty of technical concepts.

I could never work alone. I love working with people with all sorts of backgrounds, and I'm constantly learning new ways of working together to leverage the skills of groups I work with. Strategic, intentional communication is at the heart of everything I do: from high-level stakeholder presentations to having effective, well-framed 1:1 conversations.
